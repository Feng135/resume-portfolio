            <h3>Hello! I'm Feng Wei</h3>
            <p>
              I'm a final-year Bachelor of Information Technology (Networking) student at Macquarie University, 
              graduating in December 2025. I have a strong foundation in computer networking, systems administration, 
              and software development, with practical experience using tools such as Cisco Packet Tracer, Linux, 
              Python, and C.
            </p>
            <p>
              My interests lie in building secure, efficient network systems and exploring areas like DevOps, 
              cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity. I've worked on several academic and personal projects, 
              including a microservices-based bike rental system, a Linux kernel module for sequence generation, 
              and an IoT-based smart office network simulation using NetSim.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alongside my studies, I have part-time work experience in customer-facing retail environments, 
              where I've developed strong communication, problem-solving, and teamwork skills. I am currently 
              seeking opportunities to apply my technical knowledge in real-world IT environments, particularly 
              in roles related to networking, systems support, or infrastructure.
            </p>
